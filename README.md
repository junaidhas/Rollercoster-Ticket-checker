# Rollercoster-Ticket-checker
A simple program with if else to check height, age and calculate the ticket is the person is eligible


A simple roller coster ticket checker program with if-else, I have set the following conditions:
-he/she should be over the height of 120 cm, if not he is not eligible
-if a person is less than the age of 12- the price ticket is 5$
-else if a person is less than 18 - the price ticket is 7$
-else over the age of 18, the price ticket is 10$

If the person wants to have a photo taken- add 3$ to the bil
